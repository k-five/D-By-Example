Since I have just learned D so these examples are not in advanced topic.
but if you are looking for some examples to start to learn D, it may
help you and I hope so.

The [tp](https://github.com/k-five/D-By-Example/tree/master/tp) directory is the collection of examples that I read and put in code with the pdf of [tutorialspoint.com(http://www.tutorialspoint.com/d_programming/)
note that most of the examples were taken from that pdf but not all, and also some of them even did not compile,
such as examples in thread part. ( under the license of main site ).

The [tour](https://github.com/k-five/D-By-Example/tree/master/tour) directory is the collection of examples that I read the tour page in the [main website](https://tour.dlang.org)
So I tried to introduce some feature of D on **tour** directory. ( under the license of main site ).

NOTE that may you see some bugs on these, because I did it in two weeks for getting familiar with D and then port my program
[renrem](https://github.com/k-five/renrem) from **C++** to **D**.

The D version of `renrem`, after getting ready will be put here so you can see a full program in D that is really useful.

And like me, may you can not install mono-D IDE on your 32 OS, so for using an IDE you can use geany or codeblock.

But if you like using emacs like I am, you can install d-mode for your emacs.
Here is the screenshot of mine:
