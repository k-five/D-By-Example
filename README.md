# D by example
### A collection of D Language examples and some feature.

Since I am just learned D so these examples are not in advanced topic.
but if you are looking for some examples to start to learn D, it may
help you and I hope so.

The `tp` directory is the collection of examples that I read and put in code with the pdf of **tutorialspoint.com**
note that most of the example was taken from that pdf but not all, and also some of them even does not compile,
such as examples in thread part. ( under the license of main site ).

The `tour` directory is the collection of examples that I read the tour page in the main website: https://tour.dlang.org/
So I tried to introduce some feature of D on `tour` directory. ( under the license of main site ).

NOTE that may you see some bug on these, because I did it in two week for getting familiar with D in then port my program
`renrem` from **C++** to **D**.

The D version of `renrem`, after getting ready will be put here so you can see a full program in D that is really useful.
